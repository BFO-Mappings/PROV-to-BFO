# SSN/SOSA - BFO, RO, CCO Mappings

SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) is a core subset ontology of the [SSN (Semantic Sensor Network Ontology)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) ontology. 

A mapping for this is derivable from the [SOSA-PROV mapping](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/prov) combined with the PROV-BFO mappings. Import both of these into your project to use them.
